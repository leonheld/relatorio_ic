	abstract = {Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continuous outbreaks around the world. Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementnoneAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).Yes I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.YesThe case series with COVID-19 were from the Affiliated Nanping First Hospital of Fujian Medical University (NPFH), located in Nanping, Fujian Province. NPFH was the designated hospital for admission of COVID-19 infection patients in Nanping city, and set up the expert group for medical treatment of COVID-19 (Conv-MG). Suspicious patients found by other medical units in Nanping city after preliminary screening should be transferred to NPFH for treatment. All patients with NCIP enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. From January 29th to February 14th, the ConV-TG of NPFH used electronic stethoscopes to auscultate the lungs of newly admitted patients with COVID-19 infection. On March 5, after all the patients were discharged from the hospital, the clinical data and laboratory examination results of the above patients were retrospectively analyzed, which included the pulmonary signs.},
